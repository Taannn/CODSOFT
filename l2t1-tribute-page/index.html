          <h1>Introduction: Rubik's Cube</h1>
          <p>
            Hungarian design teacher and serious puzzler Erno Rubik assembled his first cube puzzle in 1974 and called it the Magic Cube. After a toy agent pitched the puzzle to Ideal Toy & Novelty Company, it renamed the puzzle Rubik’s Cube and began putting it in stores in 1980. Soon puzzlers all over the world wanted to solve the cube. Within two years they bought one hundred million of them, making Rubik’s Cube the title of most popular puzzle in history. Its success fostered hundreds of spin-off products, from best-selling books on how to solve it to patent-infringing look-alikes by other manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though media first circulated a story about Rubik designing the cube to help teach students about three-dimensional objects, Rubik himself later acknowledged that he purposefully set out to design a puzzle based on geometry. The 27 tiny cubes called “cubies” produced a truly challenging puzzle. Each carried one of six colors, and when assembled they formed a square. Rubik’s challenge was figuring a way to allow the cubies to slide and rotate alongside one another while holding together as a unit. His key insight lay in realizing that if the individual blocks hinged on a rounded core, they could move freely while maintaining the shape of a cube.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young puzzlers, known as “cubers,” are attracted to the seeming simplicity of the puzzle, and are often skilled at spotting  the patterns—cubers call them algorithms—necessary to solve the cube. Since 2003, cube-solving speed records, held by “speedcubers,” have been governed by the World Cube Association. Devoted to fairness and fun, the Association maintains records for blindfolded, one-handed, and fewest moves to solve, among others.

            &quot;I was searching for a way to demonstrate 3D movement to my students and one day found myself staring into the River Danube, looking at how the water moved around the pebbles. This became the inspiration for the cube's twisting mechanism. The fact that it can do this without falling apart is part of its magic.&quot;

            </h2>
            <p>
              The Rubik's Cube is a marvel of engineering and design, consisting of 26 smaller cubes that form a 3x3x3 structure. Each of these smaller cubes, often referred to as "cubies," is connected to an internal core that allows them to move independently.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core itself is designed to hold the cubies together while enabling smooth rotation along three axes. The outer surfaces of the cubies are colored, traditionally using six solid colors: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. This color scheme not only aids in solving the puzzle but also adds to its visual appeal. The design ensures that no matter how the cube is twisted and turned, it remains a cohesive unit, ready for the solver's next move.

            <h2>Rubik's Cube: Mechanism</h2>
            <p>
              The Rubik's Cube's mechanism is a sophisticated system that allows the puzzle to be both challenging and durable. At the heart of the cube lies a central core with six fixed center pieces, each connected to an internal spindle. This core serves as the anchor for the 20 movable edge and corner pieces, which slide over the core's surface as the cube is manipulated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The edge pieces, each with two colored stickers, and the corner pieces, each with three colored stickers, are ingeniously designed to fit together without jamming, ensuring smooth and precise rotations. This intricate mechanism is what makes the Rubik's Cube both a tactile delight and a formidable puzzle.

              How is it solved?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Solving the Rubik's Cube is both an art and a science, involving a series of algorithmic steps that transform the cube from a jumbled mess into a uniform, color-matched state. Beginners often start with the layer-by-layer method, solving one face and its corresponding edge pieces first, followed by the middle layer edges, and finally the last layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more advanced cubers, methods like CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) or Roux are employed to achieve faster solving times. These methods break the solving process into smaller, more manageable parts and optimize the number of moves required.

            <p>
              Rubik&apos;s Cube also evolved into various forms of electronic game play. In 1982, Atari published Atari Video Cube for the Atari 2600 home console. The game featured a traditional Rubik&apos;s Cube, but instead of twisting the various levels, the player moved from square to square, switching each color. Since then, additional electronic Rubik&apos;s games have appeared on various consoles, including Rubik&apos;s Puzzle World, published for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS in 2008. Game play involves solving the traditional Rubik&apos;s Cube puzzle as well as several other mini-game puzzles. PC  gamers  might enjoy Rubik&apos;s Games, published by Hasbro Interactive in 1999. It contains 100 challenges across five different puzzle games, including a standard Rubik&apos;s Cube that players can rotate by using a mouse.

            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece"></i>Rubik&apos;s Revolution & Rubik&apos;s Touch</h2>
            <p>
              Rubik&apos;s Revolution and Rubik&apos;s Touch, both handheld electronic games, resemble the classic Rubik&apos;s Cube puzzle but provide various twists. Rubik&apos;s Revolution is shaped like a traditional cube, but each square includes an LED light. The cube contains six unique games, all of which require the player to follow the lighted patterns across the cube. Its popularity earned it the Toy of the Year Award in 2008. Rubik&apos;s Touch plays exactly like a traditional cube, but instead of twisting each level, the player simply slides her finger across the sides of the cube to move the colors around. The cube also provides hints to players who become stuck during the game.
