## Level 1 Task 1: Landing Page

A tech services static landing page called Noctis | Pioneers. In this project, I was able tp practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was a fun experience  thinking about css properties/selectors that I forgot and using the classic @media again without the use of css frameworks for rwd and html/css tricks.
