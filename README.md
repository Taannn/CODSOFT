## Level 1 Task 1: Landing Page

A tech services static landing page called Noctis | Pioneers. In this project, I was able tp practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was a fun experience  thinking about css properties/selectors that I forgot and using the classic @media again without the use of css frameworks for rwd and html/css tricks.

## Level 1 Task 3: Calculator

a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. Designed to resemble an actual calculator. In terms of logic, it is only capable of doing one calculation using eval(), if more than one, the operator precedence wins instead of calculating form left-to-right. It was a fun experience especially the designing part.
